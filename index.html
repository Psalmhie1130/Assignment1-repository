            bustling city of Lagos, my fascination with technology ignited at a
            young age. Presently, I am a dedicated student on a journey of
            self-discovery and knowledge, I pursued my interest by obtaining a
            ND in Computer engineering from a prestigious institution (
            YABATECH), where I honed my programming skills and fostered a deep
            understanding of software development.To broaden my horizons, I made
            the decision to embark on a journey of skill development. My chosen
            path led me to <strong>Alt School Africa</strong>, where I am
            dedicated to mastering a craft that will equip me with valuable
            skills for the future My Alt School Africa ID is
